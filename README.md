# Introduction
This toolkit was created in the context of a Bachelor's Thesis for the Games Engineering course of study at the University of Würzburg, Germany.
The topic of the thesis was to analyze the effect of different game mechanics on the difficulty of Match-3 games, keeping in mind the many forms these games can come in.
The toolkit includes several mechanics that have been identified as being common in many Match-3 games, and includes functionality to create custom level layouts and collect gameplay metrics.
The thesis was also the basis for a short paper published at the IEEE Conference on Games 2024.

The thesis was created under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Sebastian von Mammen, head of the Games Engineering research group at the University of Würzburg and main person responsible for the Games Engineering course of study as part of the Chair for Human-Computer Interaction.
